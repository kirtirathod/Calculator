# Calculator
Java Console Calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations with a simple command-line interface.

# Features
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
Error handling for divide-by-zero
# what I did in This Project
* Develop a java-based console application that acts as a basic calculator.
* Implements four core arithmetic operations: Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division.
* Handled user input using scanner class for dynamic runtime intraction.
* Used method for each operation to keep the code modular and clean.
* Addede error handling for division by zero to avoid crashes.
* Design a menu driven interface using switch case for smooth user exprience.
* Applied looping(while loop) so that the user can perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
